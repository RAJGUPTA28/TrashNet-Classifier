Failing to segregate trade waste properly means that it will end up mixed in landfills the same way it was mixed in your bins.

 

Waste items like food scraps, paper, and liquid waste can mix and decompose, releasing run-off into the soil and harmful gas into the atmosphere.

The idea is to decrease the human intervention and make this waste segregation process more productive. As demonstrated, User can take or upload an image and the model will predict which type of waste it is. Hence, It can get land in correct recycle bin.
